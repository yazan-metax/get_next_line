# get_next_line() üóÇÔ∏è

## introduction:)

- The get_next_line() function in C is a custom function often used for reading a file line by line. It's particularly handy when dealing with input from files of unknown or dynamic lengths. This function reads the file descriptor until a newline character ('\n') is encountered, allowing you to process the file content line by line.

Its core functionality typically involves reading from a file or an input stream (like stdin) until it reaches a newline character or the end of the file. Upon encountering a newline character, it stores the line read into a buffer and returns it to the calling function. Subsequent calls to get_next_line() continue from where the previous call left off, allowing you to retrieve subsequent lines.
