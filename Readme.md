# get_next_line() üëìüìÅ

## introduction:)

- The get_next_line() function in C is a custom function often used for reading a file line by line. It's particularly handy when dealing with input from files of unknown or dynamic lengths. This function reads the file descriptor until a newline character ('\n') is encountered, allowing you to process the file content line by line.

- Its core functionality typically involves reading from a file or an input stream (like stdin) until it reaches a newline character or the end of the file. Upon encountering a newline character, it stores the line read into a buffer and returns it to the calling function. Subsequent calls to get_next_line() continue from where the previous call left off, allowing you to retrieve subsequent lines.


## requirements ‚ÑπÔ∏è:

- ### ‚úèÔ∏èGeneral Information about `open()`, `read()` Functions, and `File Descriptors`.

### open() Function:
```
- open() is a system call used to open files in C. It returns a file descriptor that uniquely identifies an open file in the operating system.
- Syntax:int open(const char *pathname, int flags);
- pathname: specifies the path to the file.
- flags: indicate the mode in which the file should be opened (e.g., read-only, write-only, read-write, etc.).
- file access modes can be specified using flags like O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR, and other options like O_CREAT, O_APPEND, etc.
